/**
 * Events that occur as text is removed, added or changed in the editor. Multiple
 * events are usually grouped together. For example, a user selects and highlights
 * multiple lines in the editor, then pastes in text over the selected area and the
 * pasted text contains multiple lines. This will cause multiple REMOVED events
 * and ADDED events, and possibly CHANGED event to occur. All the events
 * will be grouped together in an array list and passed to a handler.
